# Introduction
DeepProSite is a framework for identifying protein binding sites that utilizes protein structure and sequence information. 
DeepProSite is fast and accurate, and it's easy to install and run. The DeepProSite web server is freely available in [here](https://inner.wei-group.net/DeepProSite).

# System requirement
python  3.7.11  
numpy  1.21.2  
pandas  1.1.3  
torch  1.8.0  
biopython  1.79  
sentencepiece 0.1.96  
transformers 4.15.0

# Install and set up DeepProSite
**1.** Clone this repository by `git clonehttps://github.com/WeiLab-Biology/DeepProSite.git` or download the code in ZIP archive.  
**2.** Download the [ESMFold](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm) model and install according to the official tutorialsï¼š
```
pip install "fair-esm[esmfold]"
pip install 'dllogger @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/dllogger.git'
pip install 'openfold @ git+https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold.git@4b41059694619831a7db195b7e0988fc4ff3a307'
```  
**3.** Download the pre-trained ProtT5-XL-UniRef50 model in [here](https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans).  
**4.** Add permission to execute for [DSSP](https://github.com/cmbi/dssp)  by `chmod +x ./script/feature_extraction/mkdssp` 

# Run DeepProSite for prediction
Run the following command to predict the binding sites of the sequence in "example.fa" on GPU (id=0):
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python infer.py --task PRO --test --seed 2022 --run_id weights --dataset_path infer_data/PRO/ --feature_path infer_data/PRO/
```

# Datasets and models
The datasets used in this study are stored in `./datasets/`  
The trained DeepProSite models can be found in `./model/`
